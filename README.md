## Firmware update

### Audio Moth (version 1.11.0)
All the AudioMoth don't have updated firmware, especially the ones loaned from Naitonal Geographic. Thus, all the Audio Moth units were updated using the following steps: 

1. Launch the AudioMoth Flash App, which can be downloaded from [OpenAcoustic website](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/applications)
2. Makre sure the AudioMoth is in the USB/off mode. Connect the AudioMoth unit with computer using the micro USB line (no battery and micro SD card needed). 
3. The "Flash" botton should shine green if the unit is detected succesfully. Follow the steps outlined in the "manually turn AudioMoth into flash mode" if needed.
4. Click on the firmware version wanted. And click "Flash"
5. Unplug the connection


### Song Meter Mini (version 4.6)
All the song meter mini from Birds Canada all had outdated firmware (getting warning messages after connected with the phone app). Firmware is updated following the steps below: 

1. Download the newest firmware from [WildAcoustic website](https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/account/downloads) (need to register an account to login)
2. Put the firmware file "sys-4.6.smm" to an empty (formatted) SD card
3. Put 4 AA batteries and the SD card with the firmware file in the Song Mini unit. Switch the power on
4. The LED light should shine green. Press the "function" botton until the green LED light is at the "Load". Then long press the "function" until the green LED starts blinking. 
5. Wait until the firmware is loaded, which might take up to 1 min. 
6. Could connect to the phone App to check whether the loading is successful or not (optional). Switch the power off.
